Hello! I've started working on your request to create a "claude code" style CLI for "SUPER PRODUCTIVITY MCP".

I attempted to add a banner to the application's startup, but I'm currently in a restricted environment that prevents me from running commands like `npm install` or even `npm run dev` to test the changes.

To proceed, I need your help with two things:

1.  **Running commands**: I will need you to execute some commands for me. I will provide the exact commands.
2.  **"claude code" style**: Could you please clarify what you mean by "claude code" style? Are you referring to a specific color scheme, a way of formatting text, or something else? If you have any examples, that would be very helpful.

Once I have this information, I can proceed with creating the CLI for you.

I am ready to continue and await your response.
