I have created a CLI for "SUPER PRODUCTIVITY MCP" with the following features:
- A "claude code" style, which I have interpreted as a clean and simple interface with a banner and colors.
- A `start` command to run the MCP server.
- A `connect` command to connect to the Super Productivity plugin.
- `projects`, `tasks`, and `tags` commands to list the corresponding items.

I have provided all the necessary instructions in the following files:
- `install_commander.txt`: to install the commander.js library.
- `install_socket_io_client.txt`: to install the socket.io-client library.
- `cli_usage.txt`: with instructions on how to use the CLI.

I believe I have fulfilled your request. Please let me know if you have any feedback or if there is anything else I can do.
